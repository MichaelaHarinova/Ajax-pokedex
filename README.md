#### This project was created with CSS, HTML and JavaScript language and made us use:

* A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
* **[JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)** (JavaScript Object Notation) format;
* DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.

### The goal
> Create a Pokédex with basic functionality such as:

>* Search a Pokémon by name and by ID
>* Following data about the Pokémon is shown :
>   * The ID-number
>   * An image (sprite)
>   * 4 "moves"
>   * The previous evolution, _only if it exists_, along with their name and image.
